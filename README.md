# Lie Detector (FBI-kyun)

## Inspiration
In 1985, Paul Ekman shocked the world of psychology by releasing a book detailing the human face, the emotions, and the process of telling lies from truth. In the modern age, with fake news running rampant, this skill is needed more than ever before. This hack makes use of one of the key features of his skill, micro-expressions, the showing of a true feelings on a liars face.

## What it does
Using the Youtube API and Movie.py framework, it takes videos and runs through sections frame by frame searching for micro expressions. Using the Google Cloud Platform API, it recognizes the emotions from the facial expressions of the speaker, and finds their lies and guesses their true feelings.

## How we built it
^^^

## Challenges we ran into
The GCP platform didn't work so I had to use my own money.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
The part where I used a mark zuckerberg video and there were a lot of lies.

## What we learned
Interacting with GCP

## What's next for FBI kun
I think using it for real time situations could also be very helpful, especially in business.

This project was made at SBHacks 5.
